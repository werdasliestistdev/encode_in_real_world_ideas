im playing with an idea to "store data on real objects". eg on mushrooms or "trees".  of course not actually store the data on it. my idea is to work always with images of these real life objects. and then we use that images to "encode data" like this: eg: a photo of a tree of specific kind.  the AI analyzes what type of object this is, and how many different characteristics there are. eg for a tree for example his rings. but not only the rings, but like the shape and "holes" of the rings as well or so. AI (eg LLM with photo capabilities)  identifies how many "variable" patterns it has, to determine how many different combinations could exist in similar trees. of course there will be a tolerance determined by the AI because somethings look different in each photo even when the same. so they are less "safe" to use as "key characteristic". but then basically the AI generates a "encoding format" based on that characteristics. so that now you define data, eg "goodbye world", and define that the identified pattern on the photo (whcih we can change of course), equal your information. and then  you get a "key" which is like the decryption key, that defines the matching of the characteristics with your information / bits. 
so now with this key, others could upload a photo of the same tree and "read" the message you encoded onto it.
and eg if there is "empty bits", because there is much more possible information to be stored onto that "characteristics" combination, others could store data into parts using the same key. 
and like if you are the first person to store something on a "pattern" (identified by AI, in the beginning probably not super accurate but enough to start), other people will be able to use the same "pattern" key, so now they can store also information and read information. 

eg like steganography / PUFs (physical-uncloneable functions)

could this even work?


Some ideas i have for some challenges:
* weather ,lighting conditions, angles... etc - later, when more advanced, we will have AI models that first "identify" a specific object. based on gps location, multiple fotos, lidar data etc, we find or create a virtual representation of that object for reusing. so maybe that works well enough to eg make sure to differentiate different trees or recognize the same even in different angle, conditions etc.
* each object gets like a global UUID then
* it doesnt have to be PERFECT anyway for the beginning. 
* it seems like almost like steganography, but just, we dont wanna encode data in the actual image file. rather into whatever we have as a result from the image file...

OK: I JUST FOUND THIS PROJECT ACCIDENTALLY ON MY COMPUTER.
i am high, thats the only reason why i am not embarrassed to share this publicly, even though the code is DUMB and useless, and clearly shows,
i have no fucking clue about what i am trying here. BUT, hear me out, really, it's gonna be fine, trust me, because:
1. i am typing this in VIM 
2. i am too lazy for even looking up md synax and can't memorize because i have always been that lazy
3. i know the code is dumb. the problem is: i am too dumb for this.

so, not sure what this list means, but, this project: is just a placeholder.
i hope someone who is smarter than me can quickly point out the flaws in the idea or the big challenges to overcome here.
i am not even working on this, i might come back to it in a few months. i got too many more tangible ideas i am working on. 
but sometimes things like this just don't let me go. i would love to solve it. but not enough, to actuall do it.
still enough to be curious...
just maybe, you can make something out of this or at least show me, why my ideas are so insanely dumb, 
so i can throw it outta mi brain.
